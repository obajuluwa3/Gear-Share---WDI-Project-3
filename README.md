*WDI Project 3 - Created by Odunayo Obajuluwa - July 21-28, 2017*

 **General Assembly, Chicago - WDI Course**

## Description
A full-stack application that allows musicians to rent out their musical equipment to other musicians.

## Technologies Used
* Angular 4
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby
* Adobe Illustrator

**Features**
* Password protected user accounts with authentication
* Account Management - add, update or remove equipment from your account
* Equipment Search - find equipment posted by other musicians

## Project Planning
- Created [Schemas and database tables](http://i.imgur.com/JXcKQEJ.png)
- Started by detailing out [User stories](http://i.imgur.com/RvcV2AL.jpg)
- Created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KJT63NaN) using Adobe Illustrator to keep track of tasks and timelines
- Created [Wireframes](http://i.imgur.com/tj4Tqd7.jpg)

## Skills & Lessons Learned
* Building databases and tables using PostgreSQL
* Built a server application with routes and password encryption and authentication using Ruby and Sinatra 
* Created a client application using Angular and utilized components and two-way data binding
* Connected server and client and enabled user to update and interact with information stored in database through client views

## Possible further development..
* Cleaner front-end - I will be taking this project further by styling the front-end using CSS and JavaScript to make it more appealing
* As shown from userstories and wireframes, the initial goal of the app was to give musicians the ability to find equipment by location but due to time constraints I could achieve this. I believe this will be achievable by pulling in a Google Maps API, computing the distance between the user's current location and the equipment location.  I plan to keep building on the foundation laid with this project.
* Devloping and deploying the app on a mobile platform using React Native or a hybrid framework such as Ionic
* Adding picture uploading functionality for equipment

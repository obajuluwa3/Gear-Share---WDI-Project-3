# Gear Share - WDI Project 3
*Created by Odunayo Obajuluwa - July 21-28, 2017*

 **General Assembly, Chicago - WDI Course**

## Description
A full-stack application that allows musicians to rent out their musical equipment to other musicians.

## Technologies Used
* Angular 4
* Sinatra
* Ruby
* Adobe Illustrator

**Features**
* Password protected user accounts with authentication
* Account Management - add, update or remove equipment from your account
* Equipment Search - find equipment posted by other musicians

## Project Planning
- Started by detailing out [user stories](http://i.imgur.com/RvcV2AL.jpg)
- Created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KJT63NaN) using Adobe Illustrator to keep track of tasks and timelines
- Created [wireframes](http://i.imgur.com/tj4Tqd7.jpg)

## Possible further development..
* As shown from userstories and wireframes, the initial goal of the app was to give musicians the ability to find equipment by location but due to time constraints I could not do this. I plan to keep building on the foundation laid with this project.
* I would like to explore styling with Angular to make the app more interactive and attractive
* Deploying the app on a mobile platform
* Adding picture uploading functionality
